# Gamified NPS Engagement Platform

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **mobile-first, gamified web platform** designed to improve awareness, engagement, and participation of young and early-career individuals in the **National Pension System (NPS)**.  
It simplifies retirement planning using interactive onboarding, visual dashboards, and real-time investment predictions.

The platform focuses on reducing onboarding friction, improving financial literacy, and motivating consistent investing behavior through gamification.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Young workers often find pension and retirement planning complex, boring, and difficult to start. Traditional NPS platforms are form-heavy and lack engagement, leading to low awareness and delayed participation.

We built an interactive prototype that:
- Guides users through onboarding step by step
- Uses gamification (points, progress, streaks) to motivate engagement
- Explains NPS Tier I and Tier II in a simple way
- Shows real-time retirement corpus predictions using compounding graphs
- Encourages informed and consistent financial planning
